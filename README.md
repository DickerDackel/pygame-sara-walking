Demo of a walking directional sprite animation

The pygame.sprite.Sprite class makes use of two attributes, rect and image.

Changing the attribute image to a @property function, the class can select
different sprites on its current state (direction, phase in animation, ...).

Below short demonstration shows a cycle of 6 animation steps for the 4
directions nort, south, east, west.
